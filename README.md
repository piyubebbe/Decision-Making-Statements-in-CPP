Aim: To study and implement C++ decision making statements Software: Mingw c/cpp compiler , VScode , online C++ compiler

#Program 1: Checking number is weather Even or Odd

The program starts with taking input of a integer in variable 'a'. Then it goes to the If statement ,if the condition matches then it goes to another if condition otherwise it shows the output whatever their is in if else statement is present. After going to another if condition , if number is divisible by 2 the output display even otherwise it show odd.

#Program 2: checking character is vowel or consonant

The program starts with taking input from user which is a character data types and checks it is vowel or consonant. Here I have checked for every vowel character as ASCII value of lowercase and uppercase alphabets are different. After matching to the suitable condition it gives the output.

#Program 3: Days using switch case

The program starts with taking input of the choice from the user basically 1-7 other than this it shows the default message which is "Invalid choice". if user gives input between 1-7 then day of the respective choice will be printed using switch case. After execution of the program we have to add break statement so that program stops till that instance.

#Program 4: Basic calculator:

The program is structured in this way that it take two input from the user and save it to the variable a & b respectively. Then a menu will appear for executing the particular operation on two numbers. After giving the choice it will switched to that particular case for performing the operation. after the operation it shows the output as per function.

#Program 5: Largest among three numbers

The program starts with taking input for the three variable in integers form and checks it one by one variable throw nested if conditions after matching through all the condition it display the output which is the greatest number among the three number and that's how is concludes.

Conclusion: we have created different types of programs based on the decision making statement and got to know that why conditions are crucial for any kind of program.
